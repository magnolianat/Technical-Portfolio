## ✨ Spotlight Features

### 📹 Instant Recording Summaries with Copilot  
No more scrambling for meeting notes! Now, Teams' AI-powered Copilot summarizes recordings in real-time, highlighting key decisions, tasks, and action items — all ready for you minutes after the meeting ends.

> _“I missed a meeting while commuting, but I had the summary before I even got to the office.”_ — Sarah, Project Manager

### 📤 Seamless File Sharing Across Orgs  
Collaboration just got simpler. Share documents with external partners — without switching platforms or creating duplicate files. Teams now supports real-time co-editing with users outside your organization.

### 🧵 Threaded Conversations in Channels  
Say goodbye to scattered replies. Our redesigned channel layout now supports **fully threaded conversations**, making it easier to follow discussions and avoid missed messages.

### 🔔 Smart Notifications  
Stay in the loop — without being overwhelmed. Smart Notifications learn your patterns and prioritize updates that matter most, like direct mentions, meeting changes, or key project discussions.

### 🪟 Pop-Out Chat Enhancements  
Need to multitask? Now you can pop out **group chats** and pin them on your screen — perfect for cross-functional projects, or that coffee chat that never ends.

### 🏃‍♀️ Faster, Leaner Teams App
